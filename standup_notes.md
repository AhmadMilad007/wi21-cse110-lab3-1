## Meeting Goals

1) Create this list prior to meeting for people to read over before starting.
   1) Add links, context, or necessary/helpful resources indented (like this).
2) Not everything on this list NEEDs to be achieved.
   1) But by listing it out, group members can refer back to the notes to get back on track.

## Meeting Notes

1) Meeting notes should be numbered based on the goal they are in reference.
   1) Small details should be listed as well (indented) for people to refer back to.
2) These notes should be concise, but also extensive when needed.
   1) Big decisions should be worded carefully so everyone can easily use the notes to get a refresher.

## Tasks to Complete

1) List out tasks that should be complete prior to next meeting (or specified date).
2) Use @Everyone to adress tasks meant for everyone, or @username to refer to specific tasks a person should be completing.
   1) This not only helps people stay on track, but also let's everyone know what everyone else is working on.
